Title: Attack on the Hardware

Group members: Aaron Yam - ajyam@ucsc.edu, Sneh Shihora - sshihora@ucsc.edu

Design Brief: Our game will be a Top-Down Shooter where the player has to move around a restricted map shooting enemies surviving as many waves as possible. The game will progress by spawning more and harder enemies each wave. The player will progress by having powerups spawn giving them various buffs. The player will also have different weapons to switch from (They start with all the weapons, no picking up or dropping). The goal is to get the most score and reach the highest wave. The player will have a limited amount of lives before having to reset back to Wave 1.
